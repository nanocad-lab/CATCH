    Assembly Process Definition Format:
        - Name: The name listed here is the name that should be referenced in the system definition.
        - Materials Cost per mm2: This is given in units of $/mm^2. This is the
            cost of the materials used in the assembly process.
        - Pick and place machine cost in USD.

    Netlist Format:
        - IO Definition Reference: IO type is defined with the type parameter.
            This name must reference an IO type in the io definition file.
        - Directionality: If the IO type referenced from the io definition
            file is defined as a bidirectional IO, there is no sense of direction.
            Alternatively, if the IO is not defined as bidirectional, the
            connections are directional with block0 as the TX block and block1
            as the RX block.
        - Area for Bidirectional Cells: If there is a bidirectional IO type
            between blocks in different technology nodes it is possible the
            TX and RX sides will have different areas despite being functionally
            equivalent. In this case, the area of the bidirectional IO follows
            the same format as above, block0 will have the area defined as TX
            area in the IO definition.
        - Black Box Count: This is the number of instances of the IO. This will
            override the bandwidth calculation, so ignore leave this as the empty
            string if you want the number of instances to be calculated from the
            bandwidth and IO definition.
        - Bandwidth: The bandwidth is defined in G-bit/s. This is the bandwidth
            of the connection in one direction for a directional connection. If
            the IO is bidirectional, this is the combined bandwidth in both
            directions. This is assumed to be symmetric so 10G-bit/s would mean
            5G-bit/s in each direction.
        - Average Bandwidth Utilization: This is the average bandwidth utilization
            of the connection. This is used for the power calculation and should be
            a number between 0 and 1.

    Description: Define connectivity between blocks for an example design. This
            has some extra explanation below and can be used as a template for 
            defining your own designs.

    Note that each parameter is required to be set to avoid throwing an error. Either
            the bb_count or the bandwidth must be defined. If bb_count is defined, the
            value set for bandwidth does not matter. To use the bandwidth calculation,
            set bb_count="".
            A list of required parameters is below:
                - type
                - block0
                - block1
                - bb_count
                - bandwidth
                - average_bandwidth_utilization
