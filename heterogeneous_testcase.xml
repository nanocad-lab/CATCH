    System Definition Format:
        - Black Box Parameters (Area, Cost, Quality, Power): These are the
            black box parameters for the chip. These can be used to override
            the computed parameters. For normal operation of the cost model to
            compute these parameters, set these to the empty string "". The
            area is in mm^2, the cost is in USD, the quality is a number between
            0.0 and 1.0, and the power is in Watts.
        - Aspect Ratio: If this is defined, this is interpreted as ratio r = x/y.
            If this is not defined, r is assumed to be 1 and the chip is square.
            Note that x = sqrt(Ar) and y = sqrt(A/r) where A is the calculated chip area.
        - X and Y Locations: This allows defining the locations of the chip relative to
            the chip below. Note that the coordinate is the position of the bottom left
            corner relative to the bottom left corner of the lower chip.
        - Core Area: This is the area required for logic and memory. A passive
            integration substrate would have a core area of 0 since the real
            area is determined by the logic area of the dies stacked on it. (mm^2)
        - Fraction Memory: This is the fraction of the core area that is memory.
            This is used for NRE design costs. Valid values are between 0.0 and 1.0.
        - Fraction Logic: This is the fraction of the core area that is logic.
            This is used for NRE design costs. Valid values are between 0.0 and 1.0.
        - Fraction Analog: This is the fraction of the core area that is analog.
            This is used for NRE design costs. Valid values are between 0.0 and 1.0.
        - Reticle Share: Since it is possible to share mask costs by splitting
            up among multiple designs, this parameter can be used to give the
            fraction of a shared reticle that is used by this design. Note that
            even if there is not a perfect reticle fit, the reticle share of 1.0
            should be used to indicate that there is not sharing. Valid values
            are between 0.0 and 1.0.
        - Buried: If this flag is true, a die does not affect the area of
            the integration substrate it is stacked on. This is useful for
            modelling EMIB.
        - Assembly Process: An assembly process should be selected from the
            assembly process file here.
        - Test Process: Select a test process from the test process file here.
            Note that this is still under development, but an update will come
            soon giving example test processes and providing support.
        - Stackup: The stackup is defined as a comma separated list of layers
            where each later starts with a number indicating how many times the
            layer is repeated. The layer name is then given after the colon.
            For example: "1:active_layer,2:advanced_metal_layer,2:intermediate_metal_layer,
            2:global_metal_layer" It is also valid to simply define a single layer.
        - Wafer Process: Select a wafer process from the wafer process file here.
        - Core Voltage: This is the core voltage for the chip used to determine
            current density based on power number.
        - Power: This is the power of the chip used to determine the number of VDD/GND bumps
            along with the core voltage.
        - Quantity: This determines the ammortization of the NRE costs.
    === The next few parameters will be used in the PDN definition but are not currently supported. ===
        - V Rail: This is the voltage rail for the chip. If there are multiple
            voltage rails, they should be comma separated.
        - Regulator Efficiency: This is the efficiency of the voltage regulator
            for the chip. If there are multiple regulators, they should be comma
            separated.
        - Regulator Type: This is the type of voltage regulator for the chip.
            If there are multiple regulators, they should be comma separated.

        - Defining 2.5D and 3D stacks:
            - As can be seen in the design below, each chip has may contain a list of nested
                chip objects.
            - The root chip is considered to be on the bottom and each chip in its list is
                stacked directly on top of it.
            - Each of those stacked chips may also contain a list of nested chip objects
                which are stacked directly on it.

    Description: Example design definition. This can be used as a template for your designs.
            In the design below, there is a MEM chiplet 3D bonded on a CPU chiplet. That stack
            and a GPU chiplet are bonded on an interposer which is the root "chip" object in
            this system definition.

    
    Note that each parameter is required to be set even if it is not relevant to the application.
            If is it not used, select a relevant value that will interact correctly with the cost model.
            If no value is selected, at least define the line as the empty string: <parameter_name="">.
            A list of required parameters for the chip object is below:
                - name
