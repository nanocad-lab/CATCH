    Layer Definition Format:
        - Name: The name listed here is the name that should be referenced stackup in the system definition.
        - Active: This flag indicates whether or not this is a layer with transistors. Currently unused.
        - Cost per mm2: This is given in units of $/mm^2. This should be the cost of the wafer divided
            by the area of the wafer. Additional factors are considered in the model to determine wafer utilization.
        - Defect Density: This is the defect density of the layer in units of defects/mm^2.
        - Critical Area Ratio: This is the fraction of the core area which should be considered to be critical.
        - Clustering Factor: Parameter for the negative binomial yield model.
        - Transistor Density: The transistor density for active layers only. Set to 0 otherwise. Values for 5nm and 7nm are
            taken from TSMC values in https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/5_nm_lithography_process and ... (Units in MTr/mm^2)
        - Litho Percent: This is the percentage of costs which come from time spent on the lithography tool.
            This is used to scale the costs relative to number of exposures per wafer.
        - NRE Mask Cost: This is the NRE cost of the mask for this layer. (Or all the masks for a combined layer.)
            Since our handling of NRE is a bit rudimentary so far in this model, we are including these parameters
            so users can experiment, but we do plan to add additional parameters layer on.
        - Stitching Yield: This is the probability that a stitch will succeed. This is used for calculating cost
            for chips or integration substrates larger than a single reticle. Note that if your process does not use
            a reticle, you can either set a very large reticle in the wafer process definition or set the stitching
            yield to 1.

    Description: Example layer definitions including both standalone combined technology
            layers and stackup layers for a fine-grained model. Note that the combined 
            technology layers are generally reasonable, but the fine-grained stackup layers
            are not. Users should replace these with the correct numbers for their process.
 
    Note that each parameter is required to be set even if it is not relevant to the application.
            If is it not used, select a relevant value that will interact correctly with the cost model.
            If no value is selected, at least define the line as the empty string: <parameter_name="">.
            A list of required parameters for the layer object is below:
                - name
                - active
                - cost_per_mm2
                - defect_density
                - critical_area_ratio
                - clustering_factor
                - transistor_density
                - litho_percent
                - nre_mask_cost
                - stitching_yield
