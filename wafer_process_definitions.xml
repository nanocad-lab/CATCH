    Wafer Process Definition Format:
        - Name: The name listed here is the name that should be referenced in the system definition.
        - Wafer Diameter: This is the diameter of the wafer in mm.
        - Edge Exclusion: This is the distance from the edge of the wafer to the first die in mm.
        - Wafer Process Yield: This is the initial yield of the wafer before individual die testing.
            It is possible this can be removed with the addition of the more sophisticated yield
            and test model.
        - Dicing Distance: This is the amount of space wasted between dies to leave room for dicing.
        - Reticle X and Y: This defines the reticle size and shape in units of mm. There are a few
            relatively standardized reticle sizes currently in use. For example, a 26x33 mm reticle.
            This does provide flexibility for defining a reticle the size of a wafer for processes
            that use one exposure per wafer or other reticle sizes currently in development.
        - Wafer Fill Grid: If this parameter is True, the approximation for number of dies that will
            be constrained to a grid pattern. If False, then the dies have more flexibility of
            placement for rows stacked on rows.
        - NRE Design Costs: This is split into back end and front end costs for logic, memory, and
            analog. The units are USD/mm^2.

    Description: Wafer process parameters for the example design. This can either be a unified place
            to edit parameters for all chips in the design or it can be a place to define different
            integration substrates and chips.

    Note that each parameter is required to be set even if it is not relevant to the application.
            If is it not used, select a relevant value that will interact correctly with the cost model.
            If no value is selected, at least define the line as the empty string: <parameter_name="">.
            A list of required parameters for the wafer_process object is below:
                - name
                - wafer_diameter
                - edge_exclusion
                - wafer_process_yield
                - dicing_distance
                - reticle_x
                - reticle_y
                - wafer_fill_grid
                - nre_front_end_cost_per_mm2_memory
                - nre_back_end_cost_per_mm2_memory
                - nre_front_end_cost_per_mm2_logic
                - nre_back_end_cost_per_mm2_logic
                - nre_front_end_cost_per_mm2_analog
                - nre_back_end_cost_per_mm2_analog

<!-- Note on source data. 
    wafer_diameter is set as one of the most common sizes https://www.universitywafer.com/silicon-wafer-diameters.html
    reticle_x and reticle_y are set according to https://semiengineering.com/chipmakers-getting-serious-about-integrated-photonics/
    edge_exclusion and dicing distance are set to arbitrary values that are somewhat reasonable. (need verification)
    wafer_process_yield is set to 1.0 to remove it from consideration. According to <fill in source here>, this should be about 0.94.
    nre, I have no sources on the NRE front and back end costs, but they are all set to zero in this process for now.

<!-- Note on usage.
    Since nre design costs differ for different technology nodes, chips of different tech nodes should reference
    different wafer_process definitions.
