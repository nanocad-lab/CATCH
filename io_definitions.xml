    Assembly Process Definition Format:
        - Name: The name listed here is the name that should be referenced in the system definition.
        - Materials Cost per mm2: This is given in units of $/mm^2. This is the
            cost of the materials used in the assembly process.
        - Pick and place machine cost in USD.

    IO Definition Format:
        - IO Type: IO type is defined with the type parameter. This is the name
            which must be referenced in the netlist.
        - Area: Area is the area of the IO cell in mm^2. This is defined in terms
            of TX and RX area for transmitter and receiver.
        - Area for Bidirectional Cells: If there is a bidirectional IO type
            between blocks in different technology nodes it is possible the
            TX and RX sides will have different areas despite being functionally
            equivalent. In this case, the TX area corresponds to the full size of
            the IO cell on the block0 side and RX area corresponds to the full
            size of the IO cell on the block1 side.
        - Bandwidth: The bandwidth is defined in G-bit/s. This is the bandwidth
            of the connection in one direction for a directional connection. If
            the IO is bidirectional, this is the combined bandwidth in both
            directions. This is assumed to be symmetric so 10G-bit/s would mean
            5G-bit/s in each direction.
        - Wire Count: The number of wires defines the total number of wires in
            the bidirectional case or the number of wires in one direction for
            directional connections.
        - Reach: This is the maximum driving distance of the IO cell defined in mm.
        - Energy per bit: Energy per bit in W. This is fairly self explanatory.
            The energy of operation for the IO cell
        - Shoreline: This length of the chip edge that the IO cell takes up.
            (Right now, this is a placeholder for future planned additions that
            will factors such as floorplan and specific IO placement into account.)
        - Bidirectional: Set this flag to True if the IO is bidirectional. If
            the flag is set to False, this will be assumed to be a
            unidirectional connection.
        

    Description: Define a starter IO cell library for the example design.

    Note that each parameter is required to be set even if it is not relevant to the application.
            If is it not used, select a relevant value that will interact correctly with the cost model.
            If no value is selected, at least define the line as the empty string: <parameter_name="">.
            A list of required parameters for the io object is below:
                - type
                - tx_area
                - rx_area
                - shoreline
                - bandwidth
                - wire_count
                - bidirectional
                - energy_per_bit
                - reach
