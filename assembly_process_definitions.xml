    Assembly Process Definition Format:
        - Name: The name listed here is the name that should be referenced in the system definition.
        - Materials Cost per mm2: This is given in units of $/mm^2. This is the
            cost of the materials used in the assembly process.
        - Pick and place machine cost in USD.
        - Pick and place machine lifetime in years over which the initial costs are ammortized.
        - Pick and place machine uptime as a fraction of ownership time. The value should be between 0 and 1.
        - Pick and place technician yearly cost in USD.
        - Pick and place time in seconds.
        - Pick and place group size. This is the number of chips that can be picked and placed at once.
        - Bonding machine cost in USD.
        - Bonding machine lifetime in years over which the initial costs are ammortized.
        - Bonding machine uptime as a fraction of ownership time. The value should be between 0 and 1.
        - Bonding technician yearly cost in USD.
        - Bonding time in seconds.
        - Bonding group size. This is the number of chips that can be bonded at once.
        - Die separation distance in mm.
        - Edge exclusion distance in mm.
        - Maximum pad current density in A/mm^2.
        - Bonding pitch in mm.
        - Alignment yield as a fraction between 0 and 1.
        - Bonding yield as a fraction between 0 and 1.
        - Dielectric bond defect density in units of defects/mm^2.  

    Description: Define a starter assembly process definition library for the example design.
            The actual parameters are intended to come relatively close to reasonable parameters,
            but users should replace these numbers with real numbers if they have them.

    Note that each parameter is required to be set even if it is not relevant to the application.
            If is it not used, select a relevant value that will interact correctly with the cost model.
            If no value is selected, at least define the line as the empty string: <parameter_name="">.
            A list of required parameters for the assembly object is below:
                - name
                - materials_cost_per_mm2
                - picknplace_machine_cost
                - picknplace_machine_lifetime
                - picknplace_machine_uptime
                - picknplace_technician_yearly_cost
                - picknplace_time
                - picknplace_group
                - bonding_machine_cost
                - bonding_machine_lifetime
                - bonding_machine_uptime
                - bonding_technician_yearly_cost
                - bonding_time
                - bonding_group
                - die_separation
                - edge_exclusion
                - max_pad_current_density
                - bonding_pitch
                - alignment_yield
                - bonding_yield
                - dielectric_bond_defect_density

<!-- Note on parameters. 
    materials_cost_per_mm2 is set arbitrarily, need a source
    machine_cost numbers are set based on discussions with Professor Iyer and Krutikesh
    machine_lifetime and machine_uptime are set to arbitrary numbers that make some sense
    picknplace_time and bonding_time are set based on discussions with Krutikesh
    technician costs are arbitrary
    die_separation and edge_exclusion are arbitrary (check if edge_exclusion here is used anymore now this is defined in the wafer_process)
    max_pad_current_density was set according to <fill in source here>
    dielecric_bond_defect_density was set to 0 since there is no dielectric bond for organic substrates.
    alignment_yield and bonding_yield are set arbitrarily with some small verification from <fill in source here>
    bonding_pitch I think was set according to UCIe standard <add source here>
    group size is set somewhat arbitrarily to show individual placement but bonding of multiple chips simultaneously
